# Training-Faster-RCNN-for-Object-Recognition
These are the codes required to train your dataset using any deep learning model available [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md).

Dependencies:
1. Tensorflow
2. Python

The explanation to the codes will be added later. The video of how to use the codes is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3fT7_RtWpc&t=3s).
